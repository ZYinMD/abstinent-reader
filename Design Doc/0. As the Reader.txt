The app can store multiple books, but it doesn't have a book shelf view. It lets you read one book at a time, which is controlled by `/src/settings.json`

You can add books by processing epub files, one book at a time.

To add a book:
	Open an .epub book in Calibre -> click the "edit" button -> select all files -> right click export as html
	Save the htmls in /books/separated-htmls/${bookName}, copy the .epub into `books/epub-source-files` for record keeping
	Edit `/processBook/settings.json`.inProcess to be the ${bookName}, inspect the htmls, see if they contain similar pattern as 阴魂
		(阴魂的pattern: 每个html有个<body>, 内含正文, 每节有一个<h2>是section title, 另外每章的第一节有个<h1>是chatper title, paragraphs是<p>)
	If similar, add the settings in settings.json, then run `npm run processBook`
		(If not similar, read `Book Processing.txt`)

To read the book:
	Change `/src/settings.json`.currentBook to ${bookName}, edit your preferred abstain time (in minutes)
	run `npm run deploy`
	Read the book at `https://zyinmd.github.io/abstinent-reader/`
