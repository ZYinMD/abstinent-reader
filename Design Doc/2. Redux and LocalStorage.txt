Redux is configured using redux-start-kit.

Inspect the store in Redux DevTools, watch the dispatches, you'll easily figure out how the app works.

The app's current view (which component to display at any given time) is determined by store.currentView

In order to remember where the user left off last time, the store is persisted in localStorage, manually. Every time on an important view change, the localStorage is updated.
